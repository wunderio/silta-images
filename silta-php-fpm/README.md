# Silta Drupal PHP-FPM base images

These images provide a container running php-fpm with a configuration optimised for Drupal projects hosted on [Silta](https://github.com/wunderio/silta). 

The image doesn't contain any PHP code, this will be added by the project-specific Dockerfiles that extend this
image.

silta-php-fpm docker images are based on official php-fpm images https://hub.docker.com/_/php/tags with a few Silta-specific additions.
